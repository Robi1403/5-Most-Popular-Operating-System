								<p>Linux is an operating system that's free for anyone to use, modify, and share. It was created by a Finnish computer science student named Linus Torvalds in the early 1990s, and it's based on the UNIX operating system. Linux is known for being stable, secure, and flexible, which makes it a popular choice for servers, supercomputers, and embedded systems. It's also great for developers and power users because of its precise control and customization options through the command-line interface. Plus, the community behind Linux is dedicated to fixing any issues that arise quickly through collaboration and transparency.</p>

								<h2 class="major">History & Background</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/linuxBG.png" alt="" /></span>
								<h3>The Free Software Foundation (FSF) and Finnish software engineer Linus Torvalds developed the Linux operating system in the early 1990s.</h3>
								<p></p>
								<p>Torvalds began working on Linux while he was still a University of Helsinki student in an effort to design a system that would resemble the UNIX operating system MINIX. He published version 0.02 in 1991, and the Linux kernel (the foundation of the operating system) in version 1.0 in 1994. Around the same time, the FSF and American software developer Richard Stallman started working on GNU, an open-source operating system that was modeled after UNIX.</p>
								<p>The ideas of Unix, a potent and significant operating system created at AT&T Bell Laboratories in the late 1960s and early 1970s, served as the foundation for the development of the Linux kernel.</p>
								<p>With its modular architecture and reputation for stability, Unix scalability, security. Many of these characteristics were also adopted by Linux, which is open-source, meaning its source code is openly accessible for anyone to read, edit, and share.</p>
								<h3>In the 1990s, Linux gained popularity due to the work of independent developers. </h3>
								<p></p>
								<p>Torvalds made the Linux kernel available for development to developers all over the world by releasing it under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Because of their combined efforts, Linux grew and evolved quickly, becoming a stable and adaptable operating system that can be used in a wide range of devices, from desktop computers and servers to embedded systems and mobile phones.</p>
								<p>Unlike Torvalds, however, Stallman and the FSF began by developing operating system tools. Subsequently, these tools were included into the Linux kernel to produce a whole system known as GNU/Linux, or more accurately, just Linux.</p>

								<h2>What makes Linux different?</h2>
								<p><b>Open Source Philosophy.</b>
									The open source tenets of Linux allow users to freely access, alter, and distribute the source code. In sharp contrast to the closed-source nature of many other operating systems, this collaborative approach promotes creativity, transparency, and a sense of community-driven development.
								</p>
								<p><b>Diverse Distributions.</b> 
									Linux is available in a variety of distributions (distros), each suited to the unique requirements of the user, unlike Windows and macOS. Because of this variety, users can select an environment according on their tastes, be it a server-oriented distribution, a user-friendly desktop version, or a lightweight system for older hardware.</p>
								<p><b>Command Line Emphasis.</b> 
									The command line interface (CLI), which gives users access to robust tools and commands for system administration, is a key component of Linux. Even with the availability of GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces), the CLI—which provides efficiency and control for proficient users—remains a crucial component of the Linux experience.</p>
								<p><b>Package Management.</b>
									Linux makes use of package management systems (like APT and YUM) to streamline the installation, updating, and uninstalling of applications. By facilitating effective dependency management and ensuring that software is sourced from reliable sources, this centralised method lowers the possibility of disputes.</p>
								<p><b>Security Model.</b>
									User privilege separation and a strong authorization system are the foundation of the Linux security concept. Linux is intrinsically more secure because of the principle of least privilege, which reduces the consequences of security breaches. A proactive community and frequent security upgrades also help to create a robust security posture.</p>
								<p><b>Community-Driven Development.</b>
									An international community of developers, enthusiasts, and users work together to improve Linux. Continuous progress, quick issue fixes, and the creation of features that suit user preferences are all guaranteed by this community-driven methodology.</p>
								<h2 class="major1">Why Linux?</h2>
								<p>Linux stands out for several key reasons that make it a pragmatic choice for many users. To begin, its cost-effectiveness is a major draw - it's free. This financial advantage alone is substantial, especially for individuals or organizations seeking an operating system without the burden of licensing fees. Additionally, Linux has a reputation for reviving aging hardware, breathing new life into older systems that might struggle under other operating systems' weightier demands.</p>
								<p>Security is another critical facet where Linux shines. Its robust security measures and prompt, frequent updates create a solid defense against cyber threats. The system's architecture is designed with multiple layers of protection, fostering a resilient shield for sensitive data. This aspect is particularly appealing in a digital landscape where privacy and protection against malicious attacks are paramount concerns.</p>
								<p>Moreover, Linux offers a level of customization that surpasses many other operating systems. The extensive range of available interfaces and tools allows users to tailor their experience precisely to their preferences and needs. This flexibility empowers users to craft a computing environment that aligns perfectly with their workflow and aesthetic preferences, providing a level of personalization that is often unmatched in other systems.</p>
