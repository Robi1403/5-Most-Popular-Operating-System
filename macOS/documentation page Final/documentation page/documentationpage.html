        <p>macOS (/ˌmækoʊˈɛs/;] previously OS X and originally Mac OS X) is an operating system developed and marketed by Apple Inc. since 2001.  It is the primary operating system for Apple's Mac computers. Within the market of desktop and laptop computers, it is the second most widely used desktop OS, after Microsoft Windows and ahead of Linux (including ChromeOS).</p>
        <p>macOS succeeded the classic Mac OS, a Macintosh operating system from 1984 to 2001. During this time, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had left Apple and started another company, NeXT, developing the NeXTSTEP platform that would later be acquired by Apple to form the basis of macOS.</p>
        <img src="pics/pic3.jpg" class="pic3" alt="mac" > 
        <p>The first desktop version, Mac OS X 10.0, was released on March 24, 2001. Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard, Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard and all releases from OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion to macOS 14 Sonoma are UNIX 03 certified.[7][8] The derivatives of macOS are Apple's other operating systems: iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, tvOS, and audioOS.</p>
        <p>A prominent part of macOS's original brand identity was the use of Roman numeral X, pronounced "ten", as well as code naming each release after species of big cats, or places within California.[9] Apple shortened the name to "OS X" in 2011 and then changed it to "macOS" in 2016 to align with the branding of Apple's other operating systems, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS.[10] After sixteen distinct versions of macOS 10, macOS Big Sur was presented as version 11 in 2020, and every subsequent version has also incremented the major version number</p>
        <img src="pics/pic2.jpg" class="pic2" alt="mac" > 
        <p>macOS has supported three major processor architectures, beginning with PowerPC-based Macs in 1999. In 2006, Apple transitioned to the Intel architecture with a line of Macs using Intel Core processors. In 2020, Apple began the Apple silicon transition, using self-designed, 64-bit ARM-based Apple M series processors on the latest Macintosh computers.[11] As of 2023, the most recent release of macOS is macOS 14 Sonoma.</p>

        <header><h1>OS History and Background</h1></header>
        <p>MacOS is an operating system created by Apple Inc., an American computer company known for manufacturing computers, smartphones, and consumer electronics that are very popular to this day. The OS was introduced way back in 1984 as an exclusive operating system of the company’s Macintosh line of personal computers. The Macintosh was the start of an era of graphical user interface (GUI) systems.</p>
        <p>When promoting the Macintosh, Apple placed a strong emphasis on the user-friendly interface of its operating system. The Mac OS (originally called just System Software, with a version number appended) was graphical in nature, unlike almost all other modern PCs. Mac OS has never been granted a license to be used with computers manufactured by companies other than Apple, with the exception of a brief period in the 1990s.</p>
        <p>In 1996, Apple acquired NeXT Computers, a competitor established by Steve Jobs following his departure from Apple. In 2001, the company introduced Mac OS X, a significant overhaul that incorporated elements from both the NextStep system and Apple's latest operating system. OS X utilized a UNIX kernel for its core software code, offering technical enhancements like memory protection and preemptive multitasking.</p>

        <h3>STEP INTO THE WORLD OF MAC OS X (EVOLUTION OF MAC OS)</h3>
        <p>The official name for Apple's operating system was Mac OS X from 2001 to 2011, covering version 10.7. In the subsequent four years, the naming convention transitioned to OS X. It wasn't until the launch of macOS High Sierra in 2016 that Apple adopted the current name "macOS," establishing a consistent naming system for their various operating systems, such as iOS, tvOS, iPadOS, and others.</p>

        <h4><b>Exclusive Software   </b> </h4>
        <p>A number of software programs are only or mostly available for macOS because of their compatibility or development focus. Popular ones are composed of:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Apple created Final Cut Pro X, a professional video editing program. </li>
            <li>Apple also developed Logic Pro X, a digital audio workstation (DAW) for music production. </li>
            <li> Apple's first-ever music production program is called GarageBand.</li>
            <li>Keynote: Apple's presentation software, a substitute for Microsoft PowerPoint. </li>
            <li>Xcode is a macOS integrated development environment (IDE) that's used for developing software, especially for watchOS, tvOS, iOS, and macOS apps. </li>
            <li>Furthermore, for historical reasons, some apps are more popular or have better functionality on Apple's platform even though they are not exclusive to macOS. </li>
          </ul>
          <p> Additionally, some apps—like Sketch for UI/UX design, Things for task management, and OmniFocus for productivity—are not only available on macOS; they are also more well-liked or have better functionality on Apple's platform for historical reasons or developer preferences.</p>
          <p>Remember that even though these programs are frequently thought of as macOS-only or as being extremely tailored for the Mac, there are plenty of other platforms with comparable features. </p>

          <h5>Apple's operating system for Mac computers, macOS, is highly regarded for a number of reasons.</h5>
          <ul>
            <li><b>User Experience: </b> The intuitive and user-friendly interface of macOS is well-known. It is user-friendly and visually appealing, making it suitable for both inexperienced and seasoned users. </li><br>
            <li><b>Stability and dependability:  </b>People appreciate Macs' stability and dependability. When compared to certain other platforms, the operating system generally has fewer problems with crashes and errors.  </li><br>
            <li><b>Integration with the Apple Ecosystem:  </b>The smooth integration of Apple products is well-known. With features like Handoff, Continuity, and iCloud synchronization, macOS combines well with other Apple devices such as iPhones, iPads, and Apple Watches.  </li><br>
            <li><b>Security:  </b>When compared to other operating systems, macOS is thought to be comparatively secure. To shield users from viruses and other dangers, it has built-in features like Gatekeeper, XProtect, and frequent security updates.  </li><br>
            <li><b>Optimization:  </b>Since Apple owns both the Mac's software and hardware, there can be greater coordination between the two. Better performance and efficiency are frequently the result of this optimization.  </li><br>
            <li><b>Updates and Support:  </b>Over time, Apple adds new features, security patches, and enhancements to macOS versions through regular updates and support.
            </li>

          </ul>

          <p>
            On the other hand, an operating system's experience can differ depending on individual needs, preferences, and use cases. Although many users think macOS is a high-quality operating system, others may prefer other versions depending on their needs and level of experience.
          </p>

          <h4><b>Resale Value   </b> </h4>
          <p>When compared to many other computers, Macs typically have a higher resale value. There are multiple explanations for this:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Build Quality:  </b>Compared to some other brands, Macs are renowned for their superior build quality and robust hardware that can hold up better over time.  </li>
            <li><b>Longevity:  </b>Compared to many Windows-based PCs, Macs frequently receive longer software support. As a result, older Macs can continue to run the newest software and receive updates, which may increase their resale value.  </li>
            <li><b>Apple Brand:  </b>There is a great reputation for Apple products, including Macs. Because of the brand's reputation for high quality, design, and user experience, many customers are willing to pay more for Apple products.  </li>
            <li><b>Demand for Resale:  </b>The secondary market has a significant demand for used Mac computers. Because they hold their value well and can still offer a dependable and high-end computing experience at a lower price point than buying new, some users prefer to buy used Macs.  </li>
            <li><b>Performance Retention:  </b>Because of their well-integrated hardware and software, Macs frequently retain their performance over time, which can make them appealing in the secondary market.  </li>

          </ul>
          <p>However, a number of variables, including the particular model, its state, the specifications, and the demand in the market at the time of sale, can affect the resale value. However, in comparison to many other computers, Macs typically hold their value rather well.</p>
